                    <p class="mb-0">The mind’s deepest desire even in its most elaborate operations, parallels man’s unconscious feeling in the face of his universe: it is an insistence upon familiarity, an appetite for clarity…That nostalgia for unity, that appetite for the absolute, illustrates the essential impulse of the human drama.</p>

                        Science is dangerous, we have to keep it most carefully chained and
                        muzzled.</p>

                    <p class="mb-0">Since I had peeped over the edge myself [and had had nothing
                        to say], I understand better the meaning of [Kurtz’s] stare, that could not
                        see the flame of the candle, but was wide enough to embrace the whole
                        universe, piercing enough to penetrate all the hearts that beat in the
                        darkness. He had summed up—he had judged. ‘The horror!’ He was a
                        remarkable man. After all, this was the expression of some sort of belief;
                        it had candour, it had conviction, it had a vibrating note of revolt in its
                        whisper, it had the appalling face of a glimpsed truth—the strange
                        commingling of desire and hate.</p>

                <blockquote class="blockquote"><p class="mb-0">In particular those who are condemned to stagnation are often pronounced happy on the pretext that happiness consists in being at rest. This notion we reject, for our perspective is that of existentialist ethics. Every subject plays his part as such specifically through exploits or projects that serve as a mode of transcendence; he achieves liberty only through a continual reaching out towards other liberties. There is no justification for present existence other than its expansion into an indefinitely open future.</p>

                <blockquote class="blockquote"><p class="mb-0">The lovers were just entering the grounds of the pension. They were leaning toward each other as the water oaks bent from the sea. There was not a particle of earth beneath their feet. Their heads might have been turned upside down, so absolutely did they tread upon blue ether.</p>

                <blockquote class="blockquote"><p class="mb-0">I am wiser than this human being. For probably neither of us knows
                    anything noble and good, but he supposes he knows something when he does not know, while I, just as I do not know, do not even suppose that I do. I am likely to be a little bit wiser than he in this very thing: that whatever I do not know, I do not even suppose I know.</p>

                <blockquote class="blockquote"><p class="mb-0">What is the meaning of life? That was all- a simple question; one that tended to close in on one with years, the great revelation had never come. The great revelation perhaps never did come. Instead, there were little daily miracles, illuminations, matches struck unexpectedly in the dark; here was one.</p>

                <blockquote class="blockquote"><p class="mb-0">I can imagine that the oceanic feeling became connected with religion later on. The ‘oneness with the universe’ which constitutes its ideational content sounds like a first attempt at a religious consolation, as though it were another way of disclaiming the danger which the ego recognizes as threatening it from the eternal world.</p>
