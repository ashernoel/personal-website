                        <p class="mb-0">The mind’s deepest desire even in its most elaborate operations, parallels man’s unconscious feeling in the face of his universe: it is an insistence upon familiarity, an appetite for clarity…That nostalgia for unity, that appetite for the absolute, illustrates the essential impulse of the human drama.</p>

                            to say], I understand better the meaning of [Kurtz’s] stare, that could not
                            see the flame of the candle, but was wide enough to embrace the whole
                            universe, piercing enough to penetrate all the hearts that beat in the
                            darkness. He had summed up—he had judged. ‘The horror!’ He was a
                            remarkable man. After all, this was the expression of some sort of belief;
                            it had candour, it had conviction, it had a vibrating note of revolt in its
                            whisper, it had the appalling face of a glimpsed truth—the strange
                            commingling of desire and hate.</p>

                    <blockquote class="blockquote"><p class="mb-0">In particular those who are condemned to stagnation are often pronounced happy on the pretext that happiness consists in being at rest. This notion we reject, for our perspective is that of existentialist ethics. Every subject plays his part as such specifically through exploits or projects that serve as a mode of transcendence; he achieves liberty only through a continual reaching out towards other liberties. There is no justification for present existence other than its expansion into an indefinitely open future.</p>

                    <blockquote class="blockquote"><p class="mb-0"> Take for instance a man driven to incessant work by a sense of deep insecurity and loneliness; or another one driven by ambition, or greed for money. In all these cases, the person is the slave of a passion, and his activity is in reality a 'passivity' because he is driven; he is the sufferer, not the 'actor'. On the other hand, a man sitting quietly and contemplating, with no purpose or aim expect that of experiencing himself and his oneness with the world, is considered to be 'passive', because he is not 'doing' anything. In reality, this attitude of concentrated meditation is the highest activity there is, an activity of the soul, which is possible only under the condition of inner freedom and independence.</p>

                    <blockquote class="blockquote"><p class="mb-0">To have faith requires courage, the ability to take a risk, the readiness even to accept pain and disappointment. Whoever insists on safety and security as primary conditions of life cannot have faith; whoever shuts himself off in a system of defense, where distance and possession are his means of security, makes himself a prisoner. To be loved, and to love, need courage, the courage to judge certain values as of ultimate concern – and to take the jump and to stake everything on these values.</p>
